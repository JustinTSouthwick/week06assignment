// For the final project you will be creating an automated version of the classic card game WAR! 
// There are many versions of the game WAR. In this version there are only 2 players.
// You do not need to do anything special when there is a tie in a round.
// Think about how you would build this project and write your plan down. 
// Consider classes such as: Card, Deck, Player, as well as what properties and methods they may include. 
// You do not need to accept any user input, when you run your code,
// the entire game should play out instantly without any user input inside of your browserâ€™s console.
